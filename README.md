Whether with MATLAB, Python or any other language or software, we provide the tools to use electronic devices and can study how to use the data collected to extract the result sets.


If you're interested in modifying or extending the OpenFeeder software or hardware, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas with the developers *before* starting to work on them.
That way you can coordinate with the OpenFeeder Team and others, giving your work a higher chance
of being integrated into the official release.
